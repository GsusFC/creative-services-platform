    "description": "This project is the refreshment of the visual identity of BUILD, a brand native to the Farcaster ecosystem. \n\nConceived and built as an open system for the community where the remanence of a retro style based on repetition and error as a source of improvement inspired by the first operating systems of the 80‘s and 90’s is anchored as the core of the visual identity. It is also open source, as the philosophy of the BUILD ecosystem and the community is intended to be a Public Good. \n\nThe new web page is an exercise of how the visual system can be transferred and applied to any digital product in a scalable way.",
