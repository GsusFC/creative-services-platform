  "description": "We partnered with Vocdoni to redesign their brand identity, positioning them as leaders in the future of voting.\n\nOur approach emphasized a visual identity that conveys their commitment to transparency, security and the progressive evolution of democratic processes. Using Webflow, we developed a no-code website with a dynamic, intuitive UI that underscores the immediacy and accessibility of digital voting.\n\nThis new identity and digital experience align with Vocdoniâ€™s mission to transform voting for a secure, decentralized and future-forward democratic landscape.",
