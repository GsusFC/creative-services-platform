  "description": "The main insight of the Eigen Airdrop stems from the fusion of EigenLayer's narrative and brand construction, along with the concept of an airdrop itself.\n\nThis allows us to design a carefully thought-out process tailored towards the \"web builders\" community, with which they can feel identified and challenged, but without leaving aside other audiences.\n\nThis airdrop process is divided into 4 phases that the user will need to navigate and complete.\n\nBy completing each step, the user will \"build\" the different concepts, where the blocks of the shapes will gradually fall from the top, reinforcing the \"airdrop\" concept and immersing themselves even more in the brand.",
